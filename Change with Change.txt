Just to buttress what I want to say, in the book Who Moved My Cheese? by Spencer Johnson

If you live in changing times and a changing environment, the best way to thrive in a changing world is to first anticipate change, then prepare for the change and eventually change with the change

While some people may use this self-isolation period to relax, gist and watch netflix and all that, some others may use it to plan, restrategise and prepare to revamp thenselves as well as their approach to work once everything returns back to normalcy

So looking at our products, projects and OEMS so far, can we use this period to seriously engage in R&D, close some of those knowledge gaps and knowing that Crestsage Limited is a project-based company, we keep hearing things like

Sprint Phase
Alpha Phase
Beta Phase
Pilot Phase
Gap Analysis
Requirement Gathering and BRDs
HA and DR
Development and Production Phase
Pipelines and sales leads
T&C in Procurement 
Taxable and Non-taxable quote items


Can we carry-out some of those planned knowledge sharing in this regards?
